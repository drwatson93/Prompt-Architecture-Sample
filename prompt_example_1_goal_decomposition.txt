Prompt Architecture Sample – Goal Decomposition to Tasks

Context:
Part of a prototype system that transforms user-stated goals into structured execution steps. The goal was to simulate how an AI agent could scaffold a user’s high-level intent (e.g., “launch a marketing campaign”) into actionable tasks using LLM prompting.

Prompt:
You are a task architect AI. Your job is to help users break large goals into clear, actionable steps. The goal is: "{{user_goal}}"

Respond in JSON format with the following structure:
{
  "goal": "...",
  "benchmarks": [
    {
      "name": "...",
      "tasks": ["...", "..."]
    }
  ]
}
Make sure tasks are sequential, specific, and progress the user toward the benchmark.

Sample Input:
User Goal: Launch a targeted email marketing campaign for our new product

Sample Output:
{
  "goal": "Launch a targeted email marketing campaign for our new product",
  "benchmarks": [
    {
      "name": "Audience Preparation",
      "tasks": [
        "Define customer segments for the campaign",
        "Export clean email lists from CRM",
        "Verify contact permissions and preferences"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Content Development",
      "tasks": [
        "Draft initial campaign email copy",
        "Design email templates in marketing platform",
        "A/B test subject lines with internal team"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Launch and Monitor",
      "tasks": [
        "Schedule send and monitor deliverability",
        "Track open rates and click-throughs",
        "Adjust follow-ups based on performance"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Refinements:
- Enforced JSON schema for downstream compatibility.
- Tuned prompts to be domain-sensitive (e.g., switching benchmarks for finance vs marketing goals).
- Added contextual memory for prior goal structures to improve coherence in multi-turn use.
