Prompt Architecture Sample – User Journey Summary Generator (GenBI)

Context:
Built for a reporting tool that guides business teams through customer behavior summaries. This prompt turns raw tabular data into executive-level summaries, tuned to specific reporting tones (e.g., brief vs. exploratory).

Prompt:
You are a business analyst AI summarizing customer activity from structured data. Output a narrative with focus on customer spend, regions visited, and behavioral patterns.

Input schema:
- total_stays: int
- total_spend: float
- primary_region: string
- loyalty_tier: string
- booking_channel: string

Output in paragraph form. Use concise language, focusing on insights a business exec would care about.

Sample Input:
{
  "total_stays": 5,
  "total_spend": 8450.25,
  "primary_region": "Hawaii",
  "loyalty_tier": "Gold",
  "booking_channel": "Direct"
}

Sample Output:
This Gold-tier customer has completed 5 stays totaling $8,450, primarily in Hawaii, and consistently books through direct channels—indicating strong brand loyalty and a high-value profile.

Refinements:
- Added tone tuning ("executive", "support agent", "marketing analyst") using few-shot examples.
- Wrapped outputs with metadata (e.g., sentiment score, tags for BI charts).
- Deployed to test via Azure OpenAI and monitored response formatting for reliability.
